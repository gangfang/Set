reflection on iOS coding:
1. for MVC, don't have view dependent on other views, views should depend on model bc user interaction/input modefiy the model, not the view, and thereafter view reflects the change. If having view depends on other views, the changes pertaining to the view may not cause by the user, but the dependent is also affected.
